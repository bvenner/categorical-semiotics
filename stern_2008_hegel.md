The concept is composed of three categories:  universality, particularity, and individuality

Each category implies the other

Some of Perice's categories:  possibility (could-be), acutality (acutally is), necessity (would-be)

Another is abduction, induction, deduction

Individual = particularized universal

Kent gives the example of an individual being a human being [universal] with particular qualities (height, weight, so-on)

This could be deduction.

Particular = individualization of the universal

Kent gives the example of qualities pertaining to an individual human being, not a "bare individual".

This example seems very unclear to me.  Perhaps this is my Peircean bias - if "particular" corresponds to "quality" within Peirce's system, then h

It also could be that "particular" corresponds to one of abudction | induction | deduction, given our level in Hegel's system (we're talking concepts).  By process of elmination, would this be abduction, or "possibility"

Universal = particularized individual

Kent's example of human beings are different from lions "by the way in which it belongs to one group of determinate individuals)

Kent's exampled doesn't help, but the formulation sounds like induction - detemine a general from "facts".

Peirce's system derives more complex levels from earlier levels.  Hegel seems to place more emphasis on "mutually recursive" concepts.  But it also seems like Peirce wavers in this commitment in later life.

The mapping between semiotics and dialectics is not going to be trivial!

Kent ends his discussion as characterizing Hegel's position as one of "conceptual realism," i.e. "the belief that concepts are part of the structure of reality."  To what extent is this different from Westphal's notion of "pragmatic realism".
