# Signs and Signals
A brief history of mathematical logic in the 20th century and the parallel development of the concepts of signals and information.    

## Form and Information

Inform - transfer of form, describes the .  Information - reificication of a relationship to a thing.  

# Signs of signs

I'd like to outline speculative grammar in this chaper.  Speculative grammar (or theoretical grammar) as the pre-critical analysis of signs themselves.  

Models of modeling, Universe of universes

The central role of reflection.  Foundations of semiotics in the notion of validity of intra-subjective knowledge.  The need to define semiotics within an existing sign system.  

All signs are arguments (i.e. induce semiosis), but not all signs are signs of arguments.  

The idea that semiotics is broader than language and includes pre-linguistic ideas.  

The same arguments applied to math - includes intuitions derived from pre-linguistic concepts such as motion.  

# Universal properties

Building category theory on universal properties.  Universal properties as final, co-universal properties as initial.  

Ellerman's notion of adjunction as involving two semi-adjunctions within a profunctor.  The notion of "brain functor", rearranging the semi-adjunctions.

Goguen's categorical systems theory.  

# Dialectics

Discuss Lawvere's work in translating Hegel's work into category theory.  Relationship between Peirce and Hegel, reason

Unity and identity of opposites as adjoint cylinder.

# Modality

Modality as adjoint logic.  Continuing reflection theme as adjunctions of adjunctions.  

# Continuity

Synechism and smooth infinitesmal analysis.  Formulation of
